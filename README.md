**EDA and Feature Engineering**

- EDA is about understanding the data, while **Feature Engineering** is about transforming and improving the data for modeling.
- EDA focuses on analysis and insight, whereas **Feature Engineering** focuses on preparation and transformation.
- EDA is typically performed before Feature Engineering but the insights gained during EDA often guide the feature engineering process.

**I EXPLOTARY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)**
#### In Data Analysis We will Analyze To Find out the below stuff
1. Missing Values
2. All The Numerical Variables
3. Distribution of the Numerical Variables
4. Categorical Variables
5. Cardinality of Categorical Variables
6. Outliers
7. Relationship between independent and dependent feature(SalePrice)


**II FEATURE ENGINEERING**

1. **Encoding Techniques**

    - **OHE variables with amny labels**
    - **count frequency**
    - **ordinal encoding**
   
2. **Techniques for Handling Missing Values**
3. **Transformation: Scaling and Normalization**
4. **Handling Imbalanced Data**
5. **Handling Outliers**
   
**III FEATURE SELECTION**
6. Feature selection

**IV MODEL BUILDING**
**V MODEL DEPLOYMENT**
