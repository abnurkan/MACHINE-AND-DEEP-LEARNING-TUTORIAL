**EDA and Feature Engineering**

- EDA is about understanding the data, while **Feature Engineering** is about transforming and improving the data for modeling.
- EDA focuses on analysis and insight, whereas **Feature Engineering** focuses on preparation and transformation.
- EDA is typically performed before Feature Engineering but the insights gained during EDA often guide the feature engineering process.

**I EXPLOTARY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)**
#### In Data Analysis We will Analyze To Find out or understand the below stuff without handling it
1. Missing Values
2. All The Numerical Variables
3. Distribution of the Numerical Variables
4. Categorical Variables
5. Cardinality of Categorical Variables
6. Outliers
7. Relationship between independent and dependent feature(SalePrice)
NOTE: you can use the following libraries  for quick EDA
- vizplot
- D-tale
- pandas profiling
- sweetviz
- autoviz
- dataprep
- lux
- klib

**II FEATURE ENGINEERING**
#### In feature engineering We will handle what we Find out or understand from EDA using the  below stuff

1. **Encoding Techniques**

    - **OHE variables with amny labels**
    - **count frequency**
    - **ordinal encoding**
   
2. **Techniques for Handling Missing Values**
3. **Transformation: Scaling and Normalization**
4. **Handling Imbalanced Data**
5. **Handling Outliers**
   
**III FEATURE SELECTION**
#### in feature selection we try to select those features that has impact to our target variables and discard the rest

6. Feature selection

**IV MODEL BUILDING**

**supervised learning**

**regression and classification**
    
    1. **Linear Regression and multiple Regression**   
    2. **Logistic Regression**
    3. **Decision Tree**
    4. **K-nearest neighbour**
    5. **SVM**
       
**Hyperparameter Tunning**

**ensemble Techniques**

- bagging(bootstrap aggregator)-random forest
- boosting-xgboosting,adaboost
- weighted average
- stacking
  
**cross validation and its types**

### unsupervised  
- **clustering**
    - K-means
    - hierarchical
    - DBscan
    - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

- **Association**
    - Apriori Algorithm
    - Eclat Algorithm
    - FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth)

- **PCA**
    - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    - Autoencoders
