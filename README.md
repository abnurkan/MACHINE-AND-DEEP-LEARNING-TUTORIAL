**EDA and Feature Engineering**

- EDA is about understanding the data, while **Feature Engineering** is about transforming and improving the data for modeling.
- EDA focuses on analysis and insight, whereas **Feature Engineering** focuses on preparation and transformation.
- EDA is typically performed before Feature Engineering but the insights gained during EDA often guide the feature engineering process.
